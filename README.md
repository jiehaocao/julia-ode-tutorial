# ODE Modelling and Parameter Estimation with Julia
This repository contains sample files explaining the basics of Julia, required to get started with ODE modelling, as well as some more advanced tutorials on simulating systems of ordinary differential equations, performing sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation and parameter identifiability analysis. In short, this repository contains all basic components needed to get started with using Julia.
